# **TB X-Ray Heatmap Visualization**

This project is a web-based application that processes chest X-ray images to identify and highlight areas indicative of tuberculosis (TB) using heatmap overlays. The application is built to provide an interactive interface for uploading X-ray images, running heatmap visualization, and displaying the original and processed images side-by-side in a visually appealing manner.

---

## **Features**
- **Upload X-ray Images**: Users can upload chest X-ray images in PNG or JPG formats.
- **Heatmap Overlay**: Automatically applies a heatmap to highlight regions suspected of TB.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Displays the original X-ray image and the processed heatmap overlay for better visualization.
- **Attractive UI/UX**: Designed with a purple-themed aesthetic and smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla JS and Canvas API).
- **Backend Processing**: MATLAB (code exported and embedded into the visualization pipeline).
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages.

---

## **How to Use**
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tb-xray-heatmap.git
   cd tb-xray-heatmap
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or deploy the application on GitHub Pages.
3. **Upload an X-ray Image**:
   - Click on the upload button and select a PNG/JPG file.
4. The application will display:
   - **Original X-ray image** on the left.
   - **TB heatmap overlay** on the right.
